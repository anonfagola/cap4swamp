# BECAUSE NOBODY FUCKING DOES

**This only works on Windows. Get fucked, Mac fags.**

* Install **Python 2.7 (3.x WILL NOT WORK)** and Pip (should come with Python)
* Download this repo as a zip and put it in any folder (preferably its own, as it'll make new folders every day you run it)
* Go to a command prompt window and type **pip install pyscreenshot**
* cd to the directory you put this in
* Type **py cap4swamp.py**
* Leave it running as you raid
* When the raid is done, press Ctrl+C (^C) in the command prompt window. This will exit the application.

### How to send to Swamp

* Look for the folder with the name "YEAR-MONTH-DAY"
* Make it a zip with a program line WinRAR
* Put it on a file sharing site like Mediafire or Mega
* Private message Swampbro with a link to the download
* Optional: Delete the folder. No need for it to take up space.
* Cry that you will never see his ass
